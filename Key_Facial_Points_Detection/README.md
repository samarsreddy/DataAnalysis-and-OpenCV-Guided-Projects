# Key Facial Points Detection in Python

### Course Objectives

In this course, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:

    -Understand the theory and intuition behind Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
    -Import Key python libraries, dataset and perform image visualization.
    -Perform data pre-processing and data exploration.
    -Perform data augmentation and image normalization.
    -Build a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network and Residual blocks using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a back-end.
    -Compile and fit Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to training data.
    -Assess the performance of trained Convolutional Neural Network model and ensure its generalization using various KPIs.
