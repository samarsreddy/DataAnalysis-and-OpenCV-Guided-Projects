# COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python

The hands-on project on COVID19 Data Analysis using Python I have done as a part of Coursera guided projects. I have divided the project into five steps and it as follows:
1. Understanding the purpose of the project, the datasets that will be used, and the question we will answer with our analysis.
2. Importing COVID19 dataset. Importing COVID19 dataset and preparing it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.
3. Finding a good Measure. Decided on and calculating a good measure for our analysis.
4. Importing World happiness report dataset, dropping useless columns and Merge it with COVID19 dataset to find correlations among our data.
5. Visualizing our results using Seaborn.
