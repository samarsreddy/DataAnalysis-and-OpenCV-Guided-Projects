#Project Structure

The hands on project on Machine Learning: Create a Neural Network that Predicts whether a Picture is a Car or Airplane. is divided into following tasks:

-Task 1: In this task the Learner will be introduced to the Course Objectives, which is to how to execute a Neural Network using raw images from the Internet.

-Task 2: The Learners will get practice Loading Images.

-Task 3: The Learner will get experience pre-processing images using the EBImage package in R.

-Task 4: The Learner will reshape the images using a Keras function called array_reshape().

-Task 5: The Learner will get practice creating Testing and Training sets.

-Task 6: The Learner will then create a classifier using one hot encoding.

-Task 7: The Learner will then build out the architecture for the Neural Network. Rectified Linear Unit ("RELU") and SoftMax will be used.

-Task 8: The Learner will then build out a loss optimizer function using cross_entropy.

-Task 9: The Learner will test to see how the model performed using a Confusion Matrix.
